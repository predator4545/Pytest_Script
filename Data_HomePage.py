#We can import a class from another file and access its class variables in another class without inheriting it.
# In Python, class variables are accessible via the class name directly,
# so there's no need to inherit from the other class unless required for design purposes.

#Key Points
#Direct Access via Class Name:

#In Python, class variables are shared among all instances of a class and can be accessed directly using the class name (ClassA.shared_variable).
#No Inheritance Required:

#Since class variables belong to the class itself (not the instance), thereâ€™s no need to inherit the class to access its class variables.
#Importing Across Files:

#You can import the class from another module (file) and directly access its class variables without needing to instantiate it.

#We can even Modify or Use the Variable in another class
#to access class variables, no need for object
#but to call any method(non static method) in a class, we need to create object for the class

#If we create static methods, then we can use without object creation, no need to have self parameter
